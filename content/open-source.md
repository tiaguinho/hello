# I always love open source.

Back in 2014, I release my first open source project, which was a simple WebCraler written in Go.
Since then, I have created several projects in Go, PHP, and Typescript (Angular).

I also had made contributions written code or doing code review in some big projects like [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), [pREST](https://github.com/prest), and [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate).

In 2018 I release one of the most important projects for me.

## History of Material Community Components

I was working in a new Email Builder for [E-goi](https://www.e-goi.com). At some point, we needed a **color-picker** but didn't like the options available, so I propose that we create one and release the project.

We release the project in January 2018, under the name ***mat-color-picker***. 

In February, I sent an email to [Stephen Fluin](https://twitter.com/stephenfluin) telling him about my idea of creating a project where we could build every component that the community wanted but did not exist in the roadmap of the Angular Team.

Today [Material Community Components](https://github.com/tiaguinho/material-community-components) have more than 17k downloads every month and help thousands of developers and companies around the world.
